# Newton's Second Law Exercise

import KineticEnergySim from '../src/components/PhysicsSims/KineticEnergySim';

A car of mass $1200kg$ accelerates at $2^2$. What is the net force?

  We use Newton's second law:
  
  $$F = m \cdot a$$

  <summary><b>Click to see Step 2: Plug in the numbers</b></summary>
  
  $F = 1200 \cdot 2$
  
  **Result:** $F = 2400N$

# Understanding Energy

Energy is the ability to do work. Moving objects have **Kinetic Energy**.

The formula is:
$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

Try changing the mass and velocity below. Notice how **Velocity** has a much bigger impact than Mass because it is squared!

## The Law of the Lever

Archimedes said: *"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."*

Can you balance the beam below?
* **Torque** = Force × Distance
* Try placing the **10kg** weight at distance **2**.
* Where do you need to put the **5kg** weight to balance it?
